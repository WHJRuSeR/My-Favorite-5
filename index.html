        <div class="line">
        </div>
        The main reason I started playing Roblox was because I saw people on YouTube play Roblox. And some of the games they played looked really cool to me. So I thought that I'll just create a Roblox account for me so that I can play. And in fact, because I was playing Roblox, I found games that were even cooler than the ones on YouTube. And the best part is that you can make people your friends in Roblox so you can play games together. And the even better part is that some of my friends also had Roblox, and so I friended them on Roblox, and now we play games together all the time.
